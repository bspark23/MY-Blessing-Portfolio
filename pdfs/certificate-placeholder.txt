CERTIFICATE PLACEHOLDER FILES NEEDED:

To add your certificates, simply place your PDF files in this pdfs folder with these exact names:

1. aws-developer-certificate.pdf
2. react-advanced-certificate.pdf  
3. fullstack-web-certificate.pdf
4. nodejs-ibm-certificate.pdf
5. typescript-fundamentals-certificate.pdf

Your CV is already set up and working: cv.pdf

The portfolio will automatically detect and display these PDFs when someone clicks on the certificate "View" buttons.

If you don't have a certificate for any of these, you can either:
- Remove that certificate from the CERTIFICATES array in portfolio-script.js
- Or replace it with a different certificate you have

The system is designed to be flexible - just drop your PDF files here and they'll work immediately!
